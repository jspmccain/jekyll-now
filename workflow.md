I like thinking about workflow - I don't think people talk about it enough. So in an effort to discuss and improve my own workflow, below is a description of tools I'm actively using. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Computing

I use [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) for working in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). (But I don't use R projects because of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32982167/rstudio-project-cannot-find-the-file-specified-on-r-session-restart?noredirect=1&lq=1) syncing issue with Google Drive, if you have a fix for this please let me know!).  In R, I am a fan of the [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org/), although I typically use a mix of base R and tidyverse packages. Favourite R packages: [beepr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/beepr/index.html), dplyr, ggplot2, and magrittr.

More and more I'm working in Python. I typically work in [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/), mainly because it was a smooth transition from R Studio. I've played around a bit with [Atom](https://atom.io/), but haven't made a switch.

I work on a Windows machine (Asus), and run [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about). For accessing computing resources remotely, I use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

I use Git and GitHub as version control via Git bash.

## Research

I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) as a reference manager, but [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) may be in the cards soon. I use a combination of markdown and MS Word for writing - the markdown to enhance transparency and reproducibility for analysis, and MS Word for collaborations and commenting.

I like to write things down, and for that I use [Leuchtturm](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebooks/). 

For posters and presentations I use powerpoint - I know there are alternatives, but these have been sufficient so far! Suggestions very welcome.
