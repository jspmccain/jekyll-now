My name is Scott McCain, I'm a PhD student with [Dr. Erin Bertrand](http://erinbertrand.blogspot.ca/) at Dalhousie University in the [Department of Biology](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/biology.html). 

I am broadly interested in how organisms interact and how they influence ecosystems. I use computational and statistical approaches, mixed in with some laboratory and field methods, to ask and answer these questions. Currently, I am working on metaproteomics of marine microbes, specifically with respect to ocean biogeochemistry. 

I did my undergraduate at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/), and worked with [Dr. Charlie Trick](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/directory/faculty/trick.html) on harmful algal blooms and bio-optics. I then moved to Halifax to work with [Dr. Heike Lotze](http://lotzelab.biology.dal.ca/) studying historical marine ecology and fisheries. I had a brief stint with [Dr. Chris Taggart](http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/) in the Oceanography department at Dalhousie, and am now working with Erin.
