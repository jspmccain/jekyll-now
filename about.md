My name is Scott McCain, I'm a PhD student with [Dr. Erin Bertrand](http://erinbertrand.blogspot.ca/) at Dalhousie University in the [Department of Biology](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/biology.html).  

I am broadly interested in how microbial metabolism and how it connects with large-scale ocean processes. I've mostly studied surface-dwelling marine microbes (the green kind). I use a combination of *in situ* observations (metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics), and mathematical modelling, to explore how microbes do what they do.

A lot of my work focuses around an (incredible) instrument called a mass spectrometer (mostly of the Orbitrap variety). But I've found using published datasets to be very fruitful ([this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31483995/) of ours was entirely conducted on >10 previously published papers!). I also spend a considerable amount of time studying bias in observations, with a strong focus on metaproteomic observations.

I did my undergraduate at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/), and worked with [Dr. Charlie Trick](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/directory/faculty/trick.html) on harmful algal blooms and bio-optics. I then moved to Halifax to work with [Dr. Heike Lotze](http://lotzelab.biology.dal.ca/) studying historical marine ecology and fisheries. I had a brief stint with [Dr. Chris Taggart](http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/) in the Oceanography department at Dalhousie, and am now working with Erin.
