I had a an interesting conversation about why there seems to be lots of volatility in player rankings for tennis (compared to hockey/soccer/etc.). We wondered is it all just a function of the number of players involved? Can the good hockey players average out the bad ones in a game, leading to more consistency? Given that I'm a fake statistician, I thought this question could be answered with some quick simulations.

How about a team is made up of players, whose athletic ability can be summarized in a number (aka 'fitness' - thanks Sarah for the evolutionary terminology). This number is drawn from a distribution of average ability within the team and some deviation. The difference in the means of two teams governs who wins the game. In the following there is a distribution of players from two teams - red/blue:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

team_average_1 <- 50
team_average_2 <- 55
std_dev <- 10
number_players <- 20

set.seed(09876)
team_1 <- rnorm(n = number_players, 
                mean = team_average_1, 
                sd = std_dev)
team_2 <- rnorm(n = number_players, 
                mean = team_average_2, 
                sd = std_dev)

player_scores <- c(team_1, team_2)
team_id <- c(rep("team_1", number_players),
             rep("team_2", number_players))

teams_df <- data.frame(player_scores, 
                      team_id)

# Who's better?
teams_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(player_scores)) + 
  geom_histogram(data = subset(teams_df, team_id == "team_1"), 
                 fill = "red", alpha = 0.6) + 
  geom_histogram(data = subset(teams_df, team_id == "team_2"), 
                 fill = "blue", alpha = 0.6) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Player Skill Level")

```

So in this one example it seems that the blue one wins and the red one loses. But we really wanted to know about volatility - on average, how often does the *better* team win? 

To make this easier, how about we assume the teams are equally "good". If they play 100 games, how close is it to 50 wins each team? 

``` {r}
winner_winner_chicken_dinner <- function(team_average_1,
                                         team_average_2,
                                         std_dev,
                                         number_players,
                                         number_games){
  
  team_1_vec <- vector()

  for(game in 1:number_games){
    team_1 <- rnorm(n = number_players, 
                    mean = team_average_1, 
                    sd = std_dev)
    team_2 <- rnorm(n = number_players, 
                    mean = team_average_2, 
                    sd = std_dev)
    if(mean(team_1) > mean(team_2)){
      team_1_vec <- c(team_1_vec, 1)
      } 
  }
  
  conclusion <- paste('Team 1 won ', 
                      sum(team_1_vec), 
                      " games, and Team 2 won ",
                      (number_games - sum(team_1_vec)),
                      ".", 
                      sep = "")
  
  return(conclusion)
}

set.seed(12345)
tournament_1 <- winner_winner_chicken_dinner(team_average_1 = 50, 
                                             team_average_2 = 50, 
                                             std_dev = 10, 
                                             number_players = 20, 
                                             number_games = 100)
print(tournament_1)

```

So it's about even - makes sense! What if we drop this down to only 1 player per team (ie. Tennis):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
tennis_tournament <- winner_winner_chicken_dinner(team_average_1 = 50,
                                                  team_average_2 = 50, 
                                                  std_dev = 10,
                                                  number_players = 1,
                                                  number_games = 100)
print(tennis_tournament)
```

So that seems like I was wrong! If we assume that the one player score, where just if one score is greater than the other, indicates a win, then it doesn't matter how many players!

### But before I admit defeat...

What about the difference in magnitude of a win. Is the average difference between games higher when there are only two players? 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Let's update this function:
winner_winner_chicken_dinner <- function(team_average_1,
                                         team_average_2,
                                         std_dev,
                                         number_players,
                                         number_games){
  
  team_1_vec <- vector()
  team_1_minus_2 <- vector()
  for(game in 1:number_games){
    team_1 <- rnorm(n = number_players, 
                    mean = team_average_1, 
                    sd = std_dev)
    team_2 <- rnorm(n = number_players, 
                    mean = team_average_2, 
                    sd = std_dev)
    if(mean(team_1) > mean(team_2)){
      team_1_vec <- c(team_1_vec, 1)
    } 
    team_1_minus_2 <- c(team_1_minus_2, mean(team_1) - mean(team_2))
  }
  
  conclusion <- paste('Team 1 won ', 
                      sum(team_1_vec), 
                      " games, and Team 2 won ",
                      (number_games - sum(team_1_vec)),
                      ".", 
                      sep = "")
  finale <- list(conclusion, team_1_minus_2)
  return(finale)
}

# Tennis tournament taking into account magnitude of difference:
tennis_tournament2 <- winner_winner_chicken_dinner(team_average_1 = 50,
                                                  team_average_2 = 50, 
                                                  std_dev = 10,
                                                  number_players = 1,
                                                  number_games = 100)
hockey_tournament <- winner_winner_chicken_dinner(team_average_1 = 50,
                                                  team_average_2 = 50,
                                                  std_dev = 10,
                                                  number_players = 20,
                                                  number_games = 100)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))

hist(tennis_tournament2[[2]], 
     main = paste("Tennis Tournament: ", tennis_tournament2[[1]]),
     ylab = "Count",
     xlab = "Difference in Skill Level between Players",
     xlim = c(-30, 30), breaks = 60)

hist(hockey_tournament[[2]],
     main = paste("Hockey Tournament: ", hockey_tournament[[1]]),
     ylab = "Count",
     xlab = "Difference in Skill Level between Teams",
     xlim = c(-30, 30), breaks = 60)

```

Aha! So the spread is way bigger for the tennis tournament. Maybe the simplification of assuming that if one score is larger than another leads to a win was a bad one. Or, maybe I don't like losing arguments and have gone down a serious [garden of forking paths](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwigkMXl8N_WAhVp7IMKHRq5B4oQFghEMAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.columbia.edu%2F~gelman%2Fresearch%2Funpublished%2Fp_hacking.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2yEx0yUehouqzqgpoRKtTO). Or better yet, maybe all of this is could be explained by some variation of the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). Who knows?
