My name is Scott McCain, I'm a PhD student with [Dr. Erin Bertrand](http://erinbertrand.blogspot.ca/) at Dalhousie University in the [Department of Biology](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/biology.html). 

I am broadly interested in how organisms interact and how they influence ecosystems. Specifically, I study microbes, and I'm currently using metaproteomics (and meta-transcriptomics/-genomics) to explore marine microbial community function. I'm ultimately interested in how microbes influence biogeochemical cycles.

I use laboratory methods and field sampling, mixed in with computational and statistical approaches, to ask and answer these questions. A lot of my work focuses around an (incredible) instrument called a mass spectrometer (mostly of the Orbitrap variety).

I did my undergraduate at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/), and worked with [Dr. Charlie Trick](https://www.uwo.ca/biology/directory/faculty/trick.html) on harmful algal blooms and bio-optics. I then moved to Halifax to work with [Dr. Heike Lotze](http://lotzelab.biology.dal.ca/) studying historical marine ecology and fisheries. I had a brief stint with [Dr. Chris Taggart](http://fishocean.ocean.dal.ca/) in the Oceanography department at Dalhousie, and am now working with Erin.
